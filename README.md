Sample Genetic Algorithm Solution Code

Problem Involved: Knapsack Problem

What is Knapsack Problem?

- this is a very known problem when it comes to genetic algorithm. In this problem we are given a set of items with its value and weight, also we are given a knapsack that has a weight limit. So we are assigned to get the highest total value of combination of items without breaking the weight limit of the bag. In this sample code we are only limiting to only one quantity per item.
